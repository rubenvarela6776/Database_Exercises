-- Create a new file in your called albums_migration.sql.
-- The first command your albums_migration.sql will need is:
--  USE codeup_test_db;
-- Next, use DROP IF EXISTS to (optionally) delete a table called albums.
-- After dropping in your SQL script, create an albums table with the following columns:
-- id — auto incrementing unsigned integer primary key
-- artist — string for storing the recording artist name
-- name — string for storing a record name
-- release_date — integer representing year record was released (Note: MySQL also supports a YEAR data type!)
-- sales — floating point value for number of records sold (in millions)
-- genre — string for storing the record's genre(s)
-- Run the script with
--  mysql -u codeup -p < albums_migration.sql
-- After running the script, connect to the MySQL client normally.
-- USE the codeup_test_db and use DESCRIBE and SHOW CREATE to verify that your albums table has been successfully created.
-- If everything looks good, remember to git push your changes!
USE codeup_test_db;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS albums;

CREATE TABLE albums (
  id INT unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  artist VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL,
  record_name VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL,
  release_date DATE NOT NULL,
  sales int(11) NOT NULL,
  genre VARCHAR(256)
